# A Modern-themed Madrid Beamer Template Inspired by Metropolis

Defined two new slides

- `\mysectionpage`: Put it after every `\section{}` to get a plain looking impact slide with the section title centered.

- `\thankSlide`: Put it after the last frame to get a plain looking impact slide with a "Thank You!" text on center.
